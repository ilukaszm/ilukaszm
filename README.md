## About me 

My name is ≈Åukasz. I come from Poland. I'm beginner fullstack developer. Currently, I'm programming in JavaScript and TypeScript. My favorite library in JavaScript is especially React and all his ecosystem like Redux, React-Router-DOM, NextJS, React-Hook-Form, Styled-components and many others. I love creating applications in these technologies. Except frontend I like creating backend code as well. The most important in my applications are optimization, efficiency and solid code. I'm big fan services of serverless.
